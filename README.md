# pilipinaselectionresults2016-scraper
Data scraper for the www.pilipinaselectionresults2016.com comelec polls result website.

##Dependencies
This scraper depends on this awesome wrapping of `requests` module which allows the request to bypass CloudFare's DDoS page -> https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape

You can do: `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the `src` directory to install the module. You have to have nodejs installed as well!

You know the drill, no need to elaborate! XD


Cheers!
